# TSM - Terminal Emulator State Machine

## This is a modified version with various cherry-picked commits from other forks. None of this is my original code - I highly recommend that you check out the commit log to see the original authors of the patches.

TSM is a state machine for DEC VT100-VT520 compatible terminal emulators. It
tries to support all common standards while keeping compatibility to existing
emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, ...
